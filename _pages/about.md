Welcome to my personal space! I'm Siwarat Laoprom – an AI enthusiast and a junior computer engineering student at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi in vibrant Bangkok, Thailand.

Over the years, I’ve immersed myself in the world of technology, blending rigorous academic learning with hands-on projects that turn complex data into meaningful insights. My journey has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and full-stack web development. I enjoy crafting innovative solutions, whether it’s developing smart algorithms to tackle real-world challenges or creating dynamic, data-driven websites.

Key areas of my expertise include:
- Designing and implementing AI/ML models that enhance decision-making and problem-solving.
- Engaging in collaborative research and projects that bridge the gap between theory and practice in computer engineering.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and CV to see detailed accounts of my projects, publications, and contributions. I’m always eager to connect with peers, mentors, and collaborators who share a passion for innovative technology.

Thank you for visiting, and welcome to my journey in tech!
